## Arista cEOS improvements
This patch release brings the following improvements to Arista cEOS:

1. Arista Ma0 MAC address is now having Arista OUI, instead of docker generated local MAC. Additionally, [System MAC address is now generated](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/pull/362) as the next MAC address from Ma0 interface.
2. ETBA environment variable is [set to `4`](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/pull/360), from its original value of `1`.
3. Default cEOS configuration now has the following config line to allow for enhanced BGP daemon to run on startup:
    ```
    service routing protocols model multi-agent
    ```

## Allow dashes in lab names
Now it is possible to safely use `-` (dashes) in lab name.
