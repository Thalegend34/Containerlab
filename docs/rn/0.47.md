## Auto-provisioning of DNS servers for the SR Linux management VRF

Containerlab is now able to automatically detect which DNS servers are configured on the hosts and [configure them](../manual/kinds/srl.md#dns-configuration) in the SR Linux'es management VRF accordingly. This aligns SR Linux nodes behavior with the behavior of regular containers launched by Docker where the DNS requests are handled by Docker's DNS resolver #1650.

## SSH Config

Even though auto accepting the changed host key is in the DNA of network engineers, the warning message is still annoying.

Containerlab now [generates an SSH config](../manual/inventory.md#ssh-config) file for each lab that removes the host key check and sets the username to the one known to Containerlab. Making it even easier to quickly SSH into the nodes #1660.
