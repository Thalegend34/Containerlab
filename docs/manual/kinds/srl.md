# Nokia SR Linux

[Nokia SR Linux](https://www.nokia.com/networks/products/service-router-linux-NOS/) NOS is identified with `srl` kind in the [topology file](../topo-def-file.md). A kind defines a supported feature set and a startup procedure of a node.

## Managing SR Linux nodes
There are many ways to manage SR Linux nodes, ranging from classic CLI management all the way up to the gNMI programming. Here is a short summary on how to access those interfaces:

=== "bash"
    to connect to a `bash` shell of a running SR Linux container:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container-name/id> bash
    ```
=== "CLI/SSH"
    to connect to the SR Linux CLI
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container-name/id> sr_cli
    ```  
    or with SSH `ssh admin@<container-name>`
=== "gNMI"
    using the best in class [gnmic](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev) gNMI client as an example:
    ```bash
    gnmic -a <container-name/node-mgmt-address> --skip-verify \
    -u admin -p admin \
    -e json_ietf \
    get --path /system/name/host-name
    ```
=== "JSON-RPC"
    SR Linux has a JSON-RPC interface, that is enabled on port 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS schemas accordingly.

    HTTPS server uses the same TLS certificate as gNMI server.

## Features and options
### Types
For SR Linux nodes [`type`](../nodes.md#type) defines the hardware variant that this node will emulate.

The available type values are: `ixr6`, `ixr10`, `ixrd1`, `ixrd2`, `ixrd3`, `ixrh2` and `ixrh3` which correspond to a hardware variant of Nokia 7250/7220 IXR chassis.

By default, `ixrd2` type will be used by containerlab.

Based on the provided type, containerlab will generate the topology file that will be mounted to SR Linux container and make it boot in a chosen HW variant.
### Node configuration
SR Linux uses a `/etc/opt/srlinux/config.json` file to persist its configuration. By default containerlab starts nodes of `srl` kind with a basic "default" config, and with the `startup-config` parameter it is possible to provide a custom config file that will be used as a startup one.
#### Default node configuration
When a node is defined without the `startup-config` statement present, containerlab will make [additional configurations](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/blob/master/nodes/srl/srl.go#L38) on top of the factory config:

```yaml
# example of a topo file that does not define a custom startup-config
# as a result, the default configuration will be used by this node

name: srl_lab
topology:
  nodes:
    srl1:
      kind: srl
      type: ixr6
```

The generated config will be saved by the path `clab-<lab_name>/<node-name>/config/config.json`. Using the example topology presented above, the exact path to the config will be `clab-srl_lab/srl1/config/config.json`.

#### User defined startup config
It is possible to make SR Linux nodes to boot up with a user-defined config instead of a built-in one. With a [`startup-config`](../nodes.md#startup-config) property of the node/kind a user sets the path to the local config file that will be mounted to a container:

```yaml
name: srl_lab
topology:
  nodes:
    srl1:
      kind: srl
      type: ixr6
      image: ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux
      startup-config: myconfig.json # a path relative to the current working directory
```

With such topology file containerlab is instructed to take a file `myconfig.json` from the current working directory, copy it to the lab directory for that specific node under the `config.json` name and mount that directory to the container. This will result in this config to act as a startup config for the node.

#### Saving configuration
As was explained in the [Node configuration](#node-configuration) section, SR Linux containers can make their config persistent, because config files are provided to the containers from the host via the bind mount.

When a user configures SR Linux node the changes are saved into the running configuration stored in memory. To save the running configuration as a startup configuration the user needs to execute the `tools system configuration save` CLI command. This will write the config to the `/etc/opt/srlinux/config.json` file that holds the startup config and is exposed to the host.

SR Linux node also supports the [`containerlab save -t <topo-file>`](../../cmd/save.md) command which will execute the command to save the running config on all the lab nodes. For SR Linux node the `tools system configuration save` will be executed:

```
❯ containerlab save -t quickstart.clab.yml
INFO[0000] Parsing & checking topology file: quickstart.clab.yml 
INFO[0001] saved SR Linux configuration from leaf1 node. Output:
/system:
    Saved current running configuration as initial (startup) configuration '/etc/opt/srlinux/config.json'
 
INFO[0001] saved SR Linux configuration from leaf2 node. Output:
/system:
    Saved current running configuration as initial (startup) configuration '/etc/opt/srlinux/config.json'
```

#### User defined custom agents for SR Linux nodes
SR Linux supports custom "agents", i.e. small independent pieces of software that extend the functionality of the core platform and integrate with the CLI and the rest of the system. To deploy an agent, a YAML configuration file must be placed under `/etc/opt/srlinux/appmgr/`. This feature adds the ability to copy agent YAML file(s) to the config directory of a specific SRL node, or all such nodes.

```yaml
name: srl_lab_with_custom_agents
topology:
  nodes:
    srl1:
      kind: srl
      ...
      extras:
        srl-agents:
        - path1/my_custom_agent.yml
        - path2/my_other_agent.yml
```

### TLS
By default containerlab will generate TLS certificates and keys for each SR Linux node of a lab. The TLS related files that containerlab creates are located in the so-called CA directory which can be located by the `<lab-directory>/ca/` path. Here is a list of files that containerlab creates relative to the CA directory

1. Root CA certificate - `root/root-ca.pem`
2. Root CA private key - `root/root-ca-key.pem`
3. Node certificate - `<node-name>/<node-name>.pem`
4. Node private key - `<node-name>/<node-name>-key.pem`

The generated TLS files will persist between lab deployments. This means that if you destroyed a lab and deployed it again, the TLS files from initial lab deployment will be used.

In case a user-provided certificates/keys need to be used, the `root-ca.pem`, `<node-name>.pem` and `<node-name>-key.pem` files must be copied by the paths outlined above for containerlab to take them into account when deploying a lab.

In case only `root-ca.pem` and `root-ca-key.pem` files are provided, the node certificates will be generated using these CA files.

### License
SR Linux container can run without any license :partying_face:.  
In that license-less mode the datapath is limited to 100PPS and the sr_linux process will reboot once a week.

The license file lifts these limitations and a path to it can be provided with [`license`](../nodes.md#license) directive.

## Container configuration
To start an SR Linux NOS containerlab uses the configuration that is described in [SR Linux Software Installation Guide](https://documentation.nokia.com/cgi-bin/dbaccessfilename.cgi/3HE16113AAAATQZZA01_V1_SR%20Linux%20R20.6%20Software%20Installation.pdf)

=== "Startup command"
    `sudo bash -c /opt/srlinux/bin/sr_linux`
=== "Syscalls"
    ```
    net.ipv4.ip_forward = "0"
    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = "0"
    net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_dad = "0"
    net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_dad = "0"
    net.ipv6.conf.all.autoconf = "0"
    net.ipv6.conf.default.autoconf = "0"
    ```
=== "Environment variables"
    `SRLINUX=1`

### File mounts
When a user starts a lab, containerlab creates a lab directory for storing [configuration artifacts](../conf-artifacts.md). For `srl` kind containerlab creates directories for each node of that kind.

```
~/clab/clab-srl02
❯ ls -lah srl1
drwxrwxrwx+ 6 1002 1002   87 Dec  1 22:11 config
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  233 Dec  1 22:11 topology.clab.yml
```

The `config` directory is mounted to container's `/etc/opt/srlinux/` path in `rw` mode and will effectively contain configuration that SR Linux runs of as well as the files that SR Linux keeps in its `/etc/opt/srlinux/` directory:

```
❯ ls srl1/config
banner  cli  config.json  devices  tls  ztp
```

The topology file that defines the emulated hardware type is driven by the value of the kinds `type` parameter. Depending on a specified `type` the appropriate content will be populated into the `topology.yml` file that will get mounted to `/tmp/topology.yml` directory inside the container in `ro` mode.
