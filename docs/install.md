Containerlab is distributed as a Linux deb/rpm package and can be installed on any Debian- or RHEL-like distributive in a matter of a few seconds.

### Pre-requisites
The following requirements must be satisfied in order to let containerlab tool run successfully:

* A user should have `sudo` privileges to run containerlab.
* A Linux server/VM[^2] and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.
* Load container images (e.g. Nokia SR Linux, Arista cEOS) which are not downloadable from a container registry. Containerlab will try to pull images at runtime if they do not exist locally.

### Install script
Containerlab can be installed using the [installation script](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/blob/master/get.sh) which detects the operating system type and installs the relevant package:

!!! note
    Containerlab is distributed via deb/rpm packages, thus only Debian- and RHEL-like distributives can leverage package installation.  
    Other systems can follow the [manual installation](#manual-installation) procedure.

```bash
# download and install the latest release (may require sudo)
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get-clab.srlinux.dev)"

# download a specific version - 0.10.3 (may require sudo)
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get-clab.srlinux.dev)" -- -v 0.10.3

# with wget
bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://get-clab.srlinux.dev)"
```

### Package managers
It is possible to install official containerlab releases via public APT/YUM repository.

=== "APT"
    ```bash
    echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/netdevops/ /" | \
    sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/netdevops.list

    apt update && apt install containerlab
    ```
=== "YUM"
    ```
    yum-config-manager --add-repo=https://yum.fury.io/netdevops/ && \
    echo "gpgcheck=0" | sudo tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/yum.fury.io_netdevops_.repo

    yum install containerlab
    ```

??? "Manual package installation"
    Alternatively, users can manually download the deb/rpm package from the [Github releases](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases) page.

    example:
    ```bash
    # manually install latest release with package managers
    LATEST=$(curl -s https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases/latest | sed -e 's/.*tag\/v\(.*\)\".*/\1/')
    # with yum
    yum install "https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases/download/v${LATEST}/containerlab_${LATEST}_linux_amd64.rpm"
    # with dpkg
    curl -sL -o /tmp/clab.deb "https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases/download/v${LATEST}/containerlab_${LATEST}_linux_amd64.deb" && dpkg -i /tmp/clab.deb

    # install specific release with yum
    yum install https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases/download/v0.7.0/containerlab_0.7.0_linux_386.rpm
    ```

The package installer will put the `containerlab` binary in the `/usr/bin` directory as well as create the `/usr/bin/clab -> /usr/bin/containerlab` symlink. The symlink allows the users to save on typing when they use containerlab: `clab <command>`.

### Manual installation
If the linux distributive can't install deb/rpm packages, containerlab can be installed from the archive:

```bash
# get the latest available tag
LATEST=$(curl -s https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases/latest | \
       sed -e 's/.*tag\/v\(.*\)\".*/\1/')

# download tar.gz archive
curl -L -o /tmp/clab.tar.gz "https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases/download/v${LATEST}/containerlab_${LATEST}_Linux_amd64.tar.gz"

# create containerlab directory
mkdir -p /etc/containerlab

# extract downloaded archive into the containerlab directory
tar -zxvf /tmp/clab.tar.gz -C /etc/containerlab

# (optional) move containerlab binary somewhere in the $PATH
mv /etc/containerlab/containerlab /usr/bin && chmod a+x /usr/bin/containerlab
```

### Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)
Containerlab [runs](https://twitter.com/ntdvps/status/1380915270328401922) on WSL, but you need to [install docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) inside the WSL2 linux system instead of using Docker Desktop[^3].

If you are running Ubuntu 20.04 as your WSL2 machine, you can run [this script](https://gist.github.com/hellt/e8095c1719a3ea0051165ff282d2b62a) to install docker-ce.

```bash
curl -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hellt/e8095c1719a3ea0051165ff282d2b62a/raw/1dffb71d0495bb2be953c489cd06a25656d974a4/docker-install.sh | \
bash
```

Once installed, issue `sudo service docker start` to start the docker service inside WSL2 machine.

??? "Running VM-based routers inside WSL"
    At the moment of this writing, KVM support was not available out-of-the box with WSL2 VMs. There are [ways](https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/ldbyxa/what_is_the_current_state_of_kvm_acceleration_on/) to enable KVM support, but they were not tested with containerlab. This means that running traditional VM based routers via [vrnetlab integration](manual/vrnetlab.md) is not readily available.

    It appears to be that next versions of WSL2 kernels will support KVM.

### Upgrade
To upgrade `containerlab` to the latest available version issue the following command[^1]:

```
containerlab version upgrade
```

This command will fetch the installation script and will upgrade the tool to its most recent version.

or leverage `apt`/`yum` utilities if containerlab repo was added as explained in the [Package managers](#package-managers) section.

[^1]: only available if installed from packages
[^2]: Most containerized NOS will require >1 vCPU. RAM size depends on the lab size. Architecture: AMD64.
[^3]: No need to uninstall Docker Desktop, just make sure that it is not integrated with WSL2 machine that you intend to use with containerlab. Moreover, you can make it even work with Docker Desktop with a [few additional steps](https://twitter.com/networkop1/status/1380976461641834500/photo/1), but installing docker-ce into the WSL maybe more intuitive.
